  <h1>A few of my favorite sites.</h1>

  <p>In a recent episode of Ruby Rogues (<a href="http://rubyrogues.com/164-rr-staying-sharp-with-dave-thomas/" target="blank">http://rubyrogues.com/164-rr-staying-sharp-with-dave-thomas/)</a> Dave Thomas said 'I think that the browser is dead. It just doesn't know it yet.' Since I heard him say that I have spent a LOT of time thinking about it. It is odd as someone who has been enamoured with building web sites and web applications for most of my adult life to consider the veracity of that thought, but the more I think about it, the more true it feels to me.</p>
  <p>
 What I see happening more and more is user interfaces receeding into the background and the focus shifting to content. The result is taking precidence over the process of acheiving it, and in the context of the web, that is a good thing. We are no longer in love with the cool widget as much as we were, and thus the widgets are fading away and the remaining content becomes primary.</p>

<p>
 For this assignment I selected three sites that I use regularly for different purposes.
</p>
<h3>Addictomatic</h3>
<p>
 <a href="http://www.addictomatic.com" target="blank">www.addictomatic.com</a> Is a multi-search tool. The site has a very simple user interface (almost as simple as The Google's). The simplicity however belies a very powerful tool. Addict-o-matic takes the terms you enter in the search field and gets results from multiple sources (Twitter, Bing, Flickr etc...). It displays the results in small panels that can be rearranged so a user can easily get a high level view of what is being said about a topic in a variety of social media sites. What I like about the site is that it is simple. It does one primary thing, (search) and then presents the results.
</p>
<ol>

  <li>Homepage focus</li>
    <p>The focus of the homepage is the search input.</p>
  <li>5 adjectives [visual]</li>
    <p>dark, fun, casual, efficient, inviting</p>
  <li>Why does it exist?</li>
    <p>Allows you to easily search for terms and recieve results from multiple social media sites at once.</p>
  <li>5 adjectives [content]</li>
    <p>There is very little content. This is a search engine interface.</p>
  <li>Usability Rating</li>
    <p>I would give it an 8 on the usability scale (that I made up in my head). </p>

  <li>Sales?</li>
    <p>This site doesn't sell anything directly. They do however host ads. I have not bought anything they have advertised.</p>
</ol>
<h3>Code Academy</h3>
<p>
 <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="blank">http://www.codecademy.com</a> is a tool we are familiar with as bootcampers. The site provides interactive coding tutorials which guide a user through coding lessons and allows users to edit/enter code challenges into their browser to test their grasp of the content. The thing I like about the codeacademy site is that the user interface fades into the background as we you using the site. The focus is clearly on the lesson at hand, and the code you are creating.
</p>
<ol>

  <li>Homepage focus</li>
    <p>The focus of the homepage is a signup form with a login form option if you are already signed up.</p>
  <li>5 adjectives [visual]</li>
    <p>light, thin, approachable, efficient, inviting</p>
  <li>Why does it exist?</li>
    <p>Provides interactive code instruction.</p>
  <li>5 adjectives [content]</li>
    <p>clear, instructive, approachable (short words), fun</p>
  <li>Usability Rating</li>
    <p>I would give it an 8 on the usability scale (that I made up in my head). </p>

  <li>Sales?</li>
    <p>This site sells subscriptions to educational content.</p>
</ol>

<h3>Apple</h3>
<p>
 The final 'favorite site' is <a href="http://apple.com" target="blank">apple.com</a>. I admire Apple as a design company. The thing that I think that Apple does incredibly well, is to tell the story of their products. What I mean here is that they tell the story how their products are used, and the lives of their users. Somehow they manage to show how essential their products are, without really talking about the product itself too much.
  </p>

<ol>

  <li>Homepage focus</li>
    <p>The focus of the homepage is a picture of people using Apple technology in fun and exciting ways.</p>
  <li>5 adjectives [visual]</li>
    <p>energetic, exciting, amped, fast, slick</p>
  <li>Why does it exist?</li>
    <p>To sell Apple products.</p>
  <li>5 adjectives [content]</li>
    <p>hip, young, new, fresh, wow</p>
  <li>Usability Rating</li>
    <p>I would give it an 7 on the usability scale (that I made up in my head). </p>

  <li>Sales?</li>
    <p>This site sells Apple products. I am writing this on one such product that I bought from them.</p>
</ol>
