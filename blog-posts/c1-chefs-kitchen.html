  <h1>Sir, your presence is requested in the kitchen.</h1>
  <p>One of the things that drew me to DevBootcamp is the focus on the development of people, not code. (Granted, the code is part of it...but bear with me.)</p>

  <p>I liked Shereef's analogy of the kitchen and the restaurant. It is a welcome reminder that complacency is a choice. A large part of my going through bootcamp is to exercise this choice for myself. </p>

  <p>It is easy to view transactions passively. We have been trained that it is a virtue to pay extra so that you don't have to worry about such things. If I pay the money, I get the reward...guarenteed right? We forget that WE are the guarentee. If I want to succeed, nay, to be awesome at bootcamp, I need to make that choice.</p>

  <p>I am excited, and a bit terrified after this first week. And that is exactly why I am choosing to do this. I'm too young to get comfortable.</p>

  <p>"It only works if everybody walking through the door says 'This is my program! This is my nine weeks! I'm going to make them amazing!'" (Shereef).</p>

  <p>Well...
