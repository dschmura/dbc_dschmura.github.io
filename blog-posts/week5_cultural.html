  <h1>Be prepared to listen...on pairing and feedback</h1>

  <h2>Birds of a feather, pairing together</h2>
  <p>When I was younger I went through a period when I watched a LOT of 'classic' movies. These were black and white movies from the golden age of cinema, the heyday of MGM, Paramount etc... There are a lot of things I liked about those movies, but one of the recurring themes was partnership. It could be Bing Crosby and Danny Kay, Fred Astaire & Judy Garland, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, Laurel and Hardy...it didn't matter. The underlying, essential truth in the story structure was that the two together made up a greater whole than the sum of their parts. Where one had a weakness, the other had a strength and together they could always find a way to at least muddle through.</p>

  <p>I think that these movies had an indelible effect on my understanding of teamwork. I really do, fundamentally believe that we do better when we work in concert with one another. </p>

  <p>Before DBC I had never done pair programming in any formal sense. There were occasions when I would ask for help from a colleague, or vice versa, but it was never a formal, anticipated exercise. I mean, we would try to help one another through a problem, but we never sat down and said...'Hey, let's spend an hour working on a problem together whether we are stuck or not!', and that is a shame.</p>

  <p>I have found pairing, deliberately pairing to be really very rewarding, and in unpredictable ways. I am learning a lot, get stuck for less time, and overall I feel like my game is 'upped' from working this way. When I say 'unpredictable', I mean it. I don't know going into a session if I am going to learn a new way to approach iterating over an array, discover a new resource that will help me better grasp a concept, learn a new trick for working with Sublime Text or just share an 'At least I'm not alone' frustration.</p>
  <p>I can't predict this, and it doesn't really matter, because all of these are rewarding. We are social beings we humans. Turns out those classic movies had it right. </p>

  <h2>I hear what you're laying down...</h2>
  <p>In my life, I have had a lot of opportunities to be offered feedback. I used to do theater, I have been a writer etc... From the time I was in high school I remember learning how to give and, more importantly (I think) receive feedback. I like to think that, for the most part, I am able to listen to feedback, and apply the lessons it holds. </p>
  <p>Receiving feedback from DBC has been...well...for lack of a better work, fine. The feedback has been, at various points reassuring (my participation is being perceived the way I expected it to) and insightful (I didn't think of it that way...but I can see how I can improve here). </p>

  <p>I have not experienced any antagonistic feedback. All of the feedback I have received has been polite and on point. </p>

  <p>The one area that I really need to improve on, is my tendency to mix driving and navigating. I am used to working alone on pairing, so I am used to oscillating between both roles fairly regularly and quickly. In fact, I often 'think with my fingers', which is to say I work ideas out by typing them out...which doesn't work great if I am playing the role of the navigator.</p>

  <p>I view providing feedback, is an important responsibility. Especially in the anonymous, textual form that we are using during phase-0. I take extra care to use unambiguous language to express my feedback. I try to provide measured and actionable criticism, if I think that would be helpful, but I don't criticize solely for the sake of writing something.</p>

  <p>Additionally, I always work to start from the standpoint of what the person I am providing feedback for is doing well. I think it is vitally important to call out, explicitly the positive things that people are doing. Sometimes people take their own positives for granted, and having someone else explicitly pointing them out can provide encouragement and reassurance. </p>
