  <h1>iValues - Perseverance</h1>
  <p>This week DevBootcamp posed the question: <em>When you think of the times in your life where you've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</em> </p>

  <p>I didn't even have to look at the list. I knew immediately that the answer was 'perseverance'. Turns out, that was not on the list. However 'Persistance' was, but it has a slightly different connotation to me, so perseverance it is.</p>

  <aside>
    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    Persistence: firm or obstinate continuance in a course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition:
    <hr />
    Perseverance: steadfastness in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success:

  </aside>

  <p>There is an important distinction between Persistence and Perseverance. Persistence is, to me, more rigid. It has the word 'obstinate' in it's definition. Perseverance is defined with 'steadfastness', which, to me at least, portends a choice. I prefer to think of myself steadfastly pursuing my goals rather than obstinately refusing to quit.</p>

  <p>Last night while out with friends the conversation turned to struggling through school. My friend is considering going back to finish his degree and how he was worried about having to take statistics. I reassured him that he could do it if he wanted, and relayed my own story of taking statistics.</p>

  <p>As an undergrad I had a very clear vision of how I say my life going. I was going to be a clinical psychologist, and I was going to revolutionize psychotherapy and mental health treatment. (I was 19 years old, and I had a lot of energy and optimism at my disposal.) </p>

  <p>In pursuit of my goal, I enrolled in college as a Psychology major. One of the requirements for graduating as a Psychology major was passing Statistics. I anticipated that I might struggle with the stats class, and so I enrolled in it the first opportunity that I could (Fall semester Sophomore year). I worked hard. Truth be told, this was the first class that I really REALLY struggled with. I studied, applied all of my best work habits, didn't procrastinate, went to tutoring sessions etc...</p>

  <p>I got a D-. </p>
  <p>Undeterred, I enrolled in the same class the following semester. I was starting to learn the parts I struggled with and wanted to keep forward momentum. I doubled down on my study habits, working even harder than I had before.</p>

  <p>By the time the Final Exam came around, I had a B in the class. (To have the class count towards my psychology major I needed a B-.) The final exam was comprised of 3 questions. I knew how to do each of them. The problem was, I worked slow. After an hour, the instructor announced "Pencils down". I hadn't finished the 3rd question. </p>

  <p>I approached the instructor and pleaded to be allowed to finish the test. I knew how to do the problem, I was just slow... The instructor refused saying 'Perhaps you should consider switching your major to Sociology...the statistics requirement for Soc majors is a lot easier.' To which I replied, in exasperation, 'Maybe you should consider switching careers and become a plumber because you obviously are a terrible teacher.'</p>

  <p>I got a D.</p>

  <p>The following year I switched to a new college and enrolled in, what was now my nemisis class, once again. I continued my good study habits and worked really hard. Since I was familiar with the material, I  was able to help other students work though areas where they got stuck. I started hosting study sessions for the class. By the end of the semester, I had passed with an A-.</p>

  <p>The following semester I was asked to become the teaching assistant for the Statistics class. The instructor told me that the class that I assisted with was the 'most successful' that he has had in recent memory teaching statistics. </p>
