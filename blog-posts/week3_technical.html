<h1>JavaScript...the good, the bad, the context.</h1>
<p>JavaScript has had a long and storied carrier. It was created (in 10 days mind) by Brendan Eich in May of 1995. 1995 was a good year for programming languages giving us Java, JavaScript (not related), Lasso, PHP, and my favorite of the bunch Ruby. I am not sure what was in the water that year, but we all benefited from it.</p>

<aside>Programming language developers became fixated on beverage names when naming their libraries. Javascript would seem to have been an exception, except that it was originally named 'Mocha' and was changed to catch some of the enthusiasm behind the juggernaut of the day 'Java'. </aside>

<p>JavaScript is popular in web development today largely because of it's ubiquity. JavaScript is supported in almost every modern web browser on every computer platform (including phones). This ubiquity insures that a developer who uses JavaScript can expect it to run in a certain way for a very wide audience.</p>

<p>One of the problems JavaScript faced (especially early in its life) was inconsistent implementation across different platforms (browsers). It got caught up in the <del>clone</del>, er um...browser wars that wreaked havoc on web development for nearly a decade.</p>

<p>Now however, there is much richer, more consistent support across browsers. Libraries such as jQuery provide even greater abstraction, smoothing over the remaining inconsistencies to allow for faster and more reliable development to occur. This has created a virtuous cycle that encourages even more adoption and support.</p>


<h3>What is good?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>near ubiquitous browser support</li>
  <li>robust ecosystem and support</li>
  <li>supporting libraries that smooth some of the bumps (jquery etc...)</li>
  <li>learning JavaScript makes you much more marketable</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is bad?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>JavaScript was historically a very limited language (no exception handling etc...)</li>
  <li>historically different browsers would implement parts of the spec differently (or not at all).</li>
  <li>This limited what developers were able to do with the language. </li>
  <li>inconsistencies </li>
  <li>It isn't ruby</li>
</ul>
