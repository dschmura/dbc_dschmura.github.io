  <h1>SQL's A Gilded Cage</h1>
  <p>This week we have been focussing on Structure Query Language (SQL). SQL is a language and structure for working with persistent data (databases). As we have been looking at SQL I have been struck with how rigid it seems to me. It feels a lot more like talking to a stupid computer than working in a language like Ruby. Ruby allows some expression, nuance. SQL is much less so. It is more of a set of rules that if you follow, will allow you a result.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the week I thought I would take a look at this 'NoSQL' business that seems to be all the rage with kids these days. NoSQL, as it's name portends, is partly a rebellion against the strictures of SQL. </p>

  <p>NoSQL does away with many of the constraints of the SQL approach. This allows for a lot more flexibility. This can be a good thing. It allows for different approaches to storing and scaling data. </p>

  <p>The problem is that each NoSQL database is it's own unique snowflake. Without the strictures of SQL, you are free to (nay...required to) define all of the implementation details that SQL provides for you. For example, NoSQL databases don't have a common way to query the data, the query solution is developed as part of the database.</p>

  <p>I know that my view is being heavily influenced by my current emotional state. I am getting ready to move to Chicago, say goodbye to my wife, our pets, our friends...my life for 3 months. I am overwhelmed with learning, and anxiety. So the thought of building my own database framework (along with the database itself) seems a bit daunting. </p>

  <p>I am glad that there are alternatives to the very rigid approach in SQL, but I think, at least for now, I will stay in the gilded cage of SQL. </p>
