  <h1>Identity and Stereotype Threat</h1>

 <p>Animals are really very good at making assumptions. Quick, semi-default judgments that help us expediently assess a situation or a possible adversary. This is a hugely useful survival skill, but (and it is a big but), it can very often lead to wrong assumptions. This type of thinking is risk-averse, but has its own risks built in.</p>

 <p>Stereotype Threat is one way that we self-sabotage. We've all heard motivational speakers and coaches tell their charges to 'visualize success'. A good portion of childhood play (essential for development and learning) involves engaging in fantasies wherein the child imagines hitting the game winning home run or taking a bow in front of a standing ovation after their master performance. It is a way for kids to try on different roles, free from expectations that might otherwise limit them.</p>

<p>Stereotype threat is the antithesis of this. It is a negative stereotype or self-characteristic that lurks in our consciousness. It is a kind of self-discrimination. The problem is significant and many studies have validated that various groups can be significantly affected by negative self-ideation. Believing that you have a negative characteristic (or might) because of some other characteristic of yourself (race, gender, age, disability etc...) can, and often does become a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. Studies have shown that certain groups perform worse on certain tasks if they believe that a group with which they strongly identify are worse at that task.</p>

<p>I think that we all struggle with this to some degree, either consciously or subconsciously. I am struggling with it now in attending DBC. I am rounding the end of my 43rd year, and, well, that makes me old in this industry. People my age are more rigid in their thinking, slower to learn new things and do not have the energy to keep up with (let alone compete) with younger developers. </p>

<p>That is the stereotype anyway. My job is to rail against that generalization. Or maybe that isn't the best approach. Maybe it is more efficacious to acknowledge the stereotype, remind myself that I am doing this to challenge myself and be a better me, and focus on my growth. After all, exceptions make the rule right? I think that each of us has every opportunity and every right to be exceptional.</p>
