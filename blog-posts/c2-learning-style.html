  <h1>Thinking in style</h1>

  <p>My Gregorc Thinking Style leans toward the random, leaning more to Concrete Random than anything. Concrete Random learners like to experiment, solve problems independently, and use intuition when learning. </p>
  <p>This is really true for me. I love to get inside of something, break it down and get to know not only <em>how</em> something works but <em>why</em> it works that way. This is really good for developing deep understanding. However, this is <em>REALLY</em>  inefficient for rapid new learning.</p>
  <p>To be honest, this is kicking my ass. The rapid pace for Dev Bootcamp, in addition to my regularly scheduled life (which includes a full time job, running a company, being a husband and dog owner) barely leaves time for me to touch on the lessons once let alone reflect and dissect them.</p>
  <p>I am frustrated...and overwhelmed. Today it really hit hard. I woke up and started filling in my assignments in the submitterator app. Are I went to submit the link for this blog post, I discovered that the entry I wrote yesterday had disappeared. This hasn't happened to me since...well...I can't remember a time since college, and that was half a lifetime ago. I am chalking it up to being, in general, overwhelmed.</p>
  <p>I am very comfortable with the notion of adapting to optimize what I can in a given situation. I know that because I tend to approach problems in a certain way, and feel comfortable learning in certain ways, that I can adapt. </p>
  <p>I am trying to get caught up enough to take a few moments to reflect on the bigger picture. I want to define 'spaces' in my day to reflect. I am busy enough that I feel like I am just bouncing from one task to the next without synthesizing...without getting to the higher ordered bit. I want to define times when I am not <em>doing</em> but just <em>reflecting</em>. And, to be clear, writing these blog entries can be a gift, a space for reflection...but I have been approaching them as another task. Now that I think about it though...if I pause for just a second, I can get a little bit of perspective. </p>
  <p>I am not sure where this fits in, but I did just notice that I am getting more efficient using Sublime Text...so while I still don't really feel comfortable with JavaScript (I certainly don't feel confident writing it), there is that.</p>
