  <h1>The biggest problem is me...</h1>

  <p>When I googled 'problems facing the tech world' the first and third (and many of the other top) results were about gender inequity in tech.</p>
  <p>It might seem strange that I would write on this issue. I am, after all a white, middle-class, man. It would be understandable to assume that, given who I am, I might not be affected by the under representations of women (and minorities) in technology. This couldn't be further from the truth</p>
  <p>In an article titled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html">'Technology's a Man's Problem' </a> Claire Cain Miller outlines how bad the situation is. "Women hold only about one-quarter of all
information technology jobs..." "... and nearly half of the women in science, engineering and technology jobs donâ€™t stick around..."

  <p>How bad is it? In the same article she explains how Pax Dickinson defended an app developed at a hackathon called 'Titstare'. </p>

  <p>When someone actually thinks that it is to say something as ridiculous as "It is not misogyny to tell a sexist joke, or to fail to take a woman seriously, or to enjoy boobies," then you know there is a serious problem in your culture. </p>
  <aside>
   "A culprit, many people in the field say, is a sexist, alpha-male culture that can make women and other people who don't fit the mold feel unwelcome, demeaned or even endangered." she explained.
  </aside>

  <p>Culture is often sighted as a key differentiator in successful companies. Companies spend large amounts both in time and resources on 'team-building' and instilling a good work culture. This is because they recognize the importance of creativity and cooperation in being successful and staying innovative. </p>

  <p>Leaders talk about 'a big tent' policy, which is a start, but the tent needs to be more than big, it needs to be inclusive. Inclusive doesn't just mean represented either. It means represented and regarded. It means safe. It means safe to speak, to share, to risk to exist and to be awesome. It means safe to challenge and try, and experiment. </p>

  <p>And by making it safe for everyone, we make it safe for ourselves. Not only that, but we get to learn, grow and come to understand different perspectives. We shift from our fixed mindset into a growth mindset, opening possibilities that defy enumeration. Everybody (even middle class white programmers) can benefit from that, and more importantly, should strive for it.</p>
