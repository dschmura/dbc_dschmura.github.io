  <h1>Unless I'm mistaken...</h1>
<h2>Expressing yourself in Ruby. If vrs Unless.</h2>
<p>One of the things that enticed me to the Ruby language was it's expressive readability. I have always been attracted to the meaning of language. Poetry, prose, verbal communication all represent the myriad of experience of our species...and frankly that is awesome. It is this richness that gave poetry, prose, song and verse. And it is this richness that allows for brilliance such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=airT-m9LcoY" target="_blank">this.</a></p>

<p>On the surface, unless is just a reversal of the if statement. I would argue however, that it represents more. It represents another way for developers to express more nuanced intent. </p>
<p>Unless is not without it's detractors however. This is partly do to some uses of unless that obscures the intent of the developer. (I would argue, most likely due to a developer trying to be clever at the expense of being clear.</p>
<p>For example, in GitHub's style guide they explicitely call out "Never use unless with else." To most of us, the if-else pattern makes sense. It maps naturally to how we might try to say something in plain english. </p>
<asside>"If there is is chunky bacon in the kitchen, eat it or else if there is peanut butter, make a sandwich. Otherwise (else) run to the store before you starve." It would feel odd to try to do that using the negative. "Unless there is chunky bacon, starve, else..." I can't even get my head to construct the idea that way. </asside>
<p>I, for one, love the flexability that the Ruby langauge allows, unless it is abused. </p>
